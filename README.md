### Tips
- Start the problem set early!
    - The earlier you start, the more time you have to get help if you run into any 
    problems.
- Test your code. 
    - Find good stopping points to test out bits of code and
    functions even when your program is only partially finished. 
    - Try out different inputs and see if you expect the outputs that you get.
- Ask for help on Twist. 
    - Remember that we are traveling together on this 
    learning journey and you don't have to struggle alone!
    - It is way more important that you get your questions answered than it is
    for you to have a perfectly working program
- Try some [rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/).
    - Find a rubber duck, or a pet rock, a stuffed animal, a figurine, a patient dog.
    - Explain your program, line by line, to the victim of your choice.
    - Sometimes this helps you think through your code and how it works, and 
    can help you find bugs and errors in your code.
- DO NOT COPY/PASTE CODE FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES unless otherwise instructed to.
    - The purpose of these exercises is for you to practice your programming skills.
    - You will only harm yourself if you do not make the effort to understand the
    programming concepts we are covering.
